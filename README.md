# react-calculator

A simple calculator programmed in React Typescript, there are so far two different calculator UI's; Android & Apple. 
Functionality is still being worked on, but for now this can solve basic, and (somewhat) complex equations. 

## Getting started:
- Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
- `yarn dev` to get the application up ad running
